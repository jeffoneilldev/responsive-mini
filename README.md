# Mini-project README.md page 
## Testing for responsive mini-project.
I put together this mini-project as I watched the tutorial for responsive design. I created a HTML file and linked a CSS file to it. In the CSS file, I used a "media query" to make the columns of content sit side-by-side as the page goes larger than 768px.
### Using GITHUB
After every step of the mini-project, I added and committed to the GIT repository. I then "pushed" the files to my GITHUB repository at the end of each tutorial.
#### Finally...
I created this README.md page to give an idea of what my project is about.
